# Summary of key bindings for my Xorg Tiling Window Managers

This documents pertains to `bspwm` and `herbstluftwm`.  It was written
on 2023-05-14.  Many of the commands called by these key bindings
invoke my custom shell scripts.

* * *

1. The `<motion>` refers to the keys `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` as well as the
   arrow keys.  The motions are for left, down, up, right,
   respectively.

2. The `<number>` refers to numbers `0` through `9`.

3. The "Super" key is the one that typically has the "Win" notation or
   the Windows logo.

4. Key bindings are expressed as a combination that includes the plus
   sign, such as `Super + d`.

5. Bindings that involve chains of key presses are known as "key
   chords".  These are expressed with the semicolon as a delimiter
   between distinct key presses.  So `Super + e ; f` means "hold down
   `Super` and press `e`; release `Super` and `e`, then press `f`".

## Environment key bindings

These apply to the "entire environment" and thus have the prefix
`Super + e ;`.

| Key                | Description                                                          |

## BSPWM

This section is incomplete.  I omit some of the more obscure
operations.

There also are a few key bindings I no longer use.  They are from the
time I had a small laptop attached to an external monitor.
