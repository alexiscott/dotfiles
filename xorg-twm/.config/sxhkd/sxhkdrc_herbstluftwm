# SXHKD module with HerbstluftWM-specific commands
#
# Part of my dotfiles: https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#
### Description
#
# Partial configuration file for the Simple X Hotkey Daemon. Meant to
# work with `herbstclient`. This is part of my dotfiles, which are
# managed with GNU Stow. See https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

### Code

# Close currently focused window. mod4+q closes the frame if no window
# is present. With shift it closes the frame of the last window while
# it closes that. With mod4+alt+q remove the frame and merge its
# windows with the closest neighbouring frame.
mod4 + {_, shift +, alt+} q
    herbstclient {close_or_remove,close_and_remove,remove}

#### Focus/swap windows/tags

# Focus in the given direction. With Shift move the window in the
# given direction. With Ctrl resize the window in the given direction.
mod4 + {_, shift +, ctrl +} {h,j,k,l}
    herbstclient {focus,shift,resize} {left,down,up,right} {_,_,0.05}

# Same as above but with arrow keys.
mod4 + {_, shift +, ctrl +} {Left,Down,Up,Right}
    herbstclient {focus,shift,resize} {left,down,up,right} {_,_,0.05}

# Place a frame in the given direction.
mod4 + alt + {h,j,k,l}
    herbstclient split {left,bottom,top,right} 0.5

# Same as above but with arrow keys.
mod4 + alt + {Left,Down,Up,Right}
    herbstclient split {left,bottom,top,right} 0.5

# Switch focus to workspace N. With Shift send currently focused
# window to that workspace.
mod4 + {_,shift +} {0-9}
    herbstclient {use_index,move_index} {0-9}

# Toggle the fullscreen and tiling/floating state of the currently
# focused window.
mod4 + {f,space}
    herbstclient {fullscreen toggle,set_attr clients.focus.floating toggle}

# Alt + Tab to cycle all windows and frames in the current tag (how
# desktop environments do it).
#
# Super + Tab to cycle all windows in the current frame.
#
# Use Shift to cycle in the opposite direction.
{mod1,mod4} + {_, shift +} Tab
    herbstclient {cycle_all,cycle} {+1,-1}

# Rotate the current workspace clockwise. With Shift mirror/flip the
# layout. This command only works if there is more thatn one frame
# available.
mod4  + {_, shift +} r
    herbstclient {rotate,mirror both}

# Cycle the layouts of the current frame. There is the option of a
# grid layout, but I do not use it.
mod4 + t
    herbstclient cycle_layout +1 vertical horizontal max

# Adjust size of frame gaps using my script.  This script of mine
# cycles through values 0 and 30, meaning that if we keep increasing
# or decreasing past either of those limits, we move to the other end:
# 0 5 ... 30 0 5.
mod4 + bracket{left,right}
    herbstluftwm_adjust_gaps.sh {-,+}5

# Like the above, but for border width.
mod4 + shift + bracket{left,right}
    herbstluftwm_adjust_borders.sh {-,+}5

mod4 + w ; {t,h,m}
    herbstluftwm_load_workspace_layout.sh {third,half,middle}
